# Filing A Complaint and Tracking it: Department of Homeland Security Website
## Zia Khoshsirat

### INTRODUCTION

>The core intention of this project is to bring users' experience with the Department of Homeland Security website in finding the relevant formation about the travel [complaint]( https://www.dhs.gov/file-travel-complaint-dhs-trip) and specifically be able to easily track their complaint [status](https://trip.dhs.gov/TRIP/Home/CaseStatus). While the original website tried to keep the structure minimalistic and straightforward, it was not straightforward for some users with less technical knowledge to access the desired information. By deploying the users' experience with the website, this project provides alternative designs to facilitate users' efficient engagement with various elements of complaining and tracking pages. Thus, in this project, the design focuses on the issues addressed during the different stages of the project through (re-)modifying elements like changing shapes, fonts, alignments, and even re-designing a whole page. These stages will be discussed in the following sections. 


### CLEAR DESIGN STATEMENT: 

>In this stage, this project intends to make navigation, finding, and tracking the complaint's status more accessible for users who might find the original design confusing. According to the feedback analyzed in this project, since the DHS is a vast section of the government, users might feel filing complaints and tracking it futile. This affective perspective would influence users’ engagement with the website, which is already confusing in its tracking section. 


### COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

>In the heuristic evaluations stage, two websites, DHS ( [Department of Homeland Security]( https://www.dhs.gov/) ) and CBP ( [U.S. Custom and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/) ) were tested to grasp a general idea about the structure of federal websites and scrutinize them for the later stages of this project. During the evaluation, issues like the contrast in Visibility of System Status and alignment in Aesthetic and Minimalist Design were noticed. However, the main issue (see Introduction) on which this project is focused was observed later.

### USER RESEARCH 

>In this stage, the goal was to concentrate on the users’ interactions with a few website pages and observe the interactions in context. Being immersed in the users’ lives and seeing the subject matter in context is recommended by UX designers and researchers (IDEO.org 2015: 51), which gives more in-depth knowledge about users’ lives, how they do not do certain activities, and why they do not. As mentioned earlier, this project focuses on the DHS travel complaint tracking page. Since TSA officers have a history of racially profiling individuals at the airport, a participant with a similar experience with TSA was interviewed for the contextual inquiry. During the interview, I wanted to document if the user can easily file a complaint against TSA profiling during the screening procedure and, in case of hesitancy, what does cause it and why. If hesitancy is the result, how we can find resolve it with an innovative design. While the participants quickly found the File a Travel Complaint (DHS TRIP) page, she did not proceed to complete the task that she was asked due to what she expressed the DHS unwillingness to pay attention to complaints. It was a crucial moment for the project, as  I found out how understanding the sociocultural aspect of a matter is important in a user experience design project.

### UX STORYTELLING

>Storytelling emplaces the subject matter in a context and takes the audience on a journey through the researcher’s eyes and the subject’s action. Storytelling promotes subjects from mere users to persons with a life that affects their decision-making, rise and fall of feelings, and how they interact with an issue. Storytelling re-contextualizes the user and the product in their real-time entanglement. Based on the project’s core intention, two personas were created to test the website from the position of users and through their perspectives. One personifies a user with a specific disability, and the other typifies a person with less technical knowledge.

### LOW-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE

>Based on the previous stages, two personas, and the analysis from the second interview, the low-fidelity prototype intends to remove the obstacle of checking the status based on the participant’s struggle with finding the status page. Thirty frames were designed to represent a specific number of tasks. Compared with the original website, several minor modifications were made in the prototype; among all, the complaint status check page was significantly changed.

### HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE

>The low-fidelity prototype helped the project to understand what should be done in the next stage: the transformation of the wireframes to high-fidelity ones. In this stage, the high-fidelity frames were created with Figma. I also used Adobe Photoshop to modify buttons (for example, the search button). Twenty-one frames were designed to fulfill specific tasks and specifically to complete complaints status tracking. After several minor and major revisions, the final design was successfully passed the user tests. It should be mentioned that two modes, dark and light, were considered for this design. However, all the final modifications were applied to the light mode. For more information, please click [**here**](https://github.com/ziiiaz/Interface/blob/main/README.md).

### OPTIONAL EVALUATION AND REVISION HISTORY

>During the impression test of the third high-fidelity design, the user wanted to go back to the home page. The design considered the logo (top of the page) as a default way of doing this task. However, the user found out that the home button at the foot bar is better for going back to the home page. Since the design did not consider an action for that button, the user was confused about how to reach the home page. This issue was resolved in the final design.

### CONCLUSIONS:

>I have been researching for seven years in different fields. It is expected to conduct an ethnography and/or fieldwork in Anthropology, which necessitates learning about methods such as interviewing, observing, participating, and situating yourself in the research. 
Through the process of doing this project, I have always considered my positionality and experience in research. For example, heuristic evaluations remind me that preliminary fieldwork and contextual inquiry resemble literature reviews and semi-structured interviews. Nevertheless, UX design and research introduced a perspective which Vargas (2006) calls observant participation. That is, the researcher is attached to what is researched and participates in the activities. During the project, I was part of the design process and participated in it retrospectively by engaging with the participants' activities. 
Regarding the positionality of the researcher and designer, the possible bias toward the design is always open to being under scrutiny with the users/participants and, ultimately, the design team. This is a crucial step in completing a design project since each portion of the process is tested before proceeding.
